# TODO LIST
  
## Drydock section

* Add display of max requirements of a hull
* Add display of hardpoints
* Disable hull that are incompatible with current selections
> This component is quite big, maybe split some of the HTML into separate components

## Shipbuilder Section

* Rework to intake props passed from drydock into a ship component to be rendered
* Make previous functionality general enough to be passed from a ship generator component


## New sections to be made

* A ship generator section
* A nav function to move between drydock/ship builder and ship generator
> Maybe name the ship generator portion space port

# Future Functionality

* NPC genrator
* Mech builder and generator
