# Welcome to the Space Dock!

The goal of this webpage is to provide a utility for generating Stars Without Number spaceships. I have personally found building spaceships from the rule book to be fun, but time consuming. Build a spaceship with all the fittings you want, without manually adjusting them for your chosen hull class, or, choose from a few parameters to have the webpage generate a ship for you!

This is still a work in progress. Some ships don't exactly fulfill their roles, and the generator can be forced to build invalid ship combinations (like putting a spike drive level 6 on a strike fighter). I hope to change these things in the future, and add a bunch more functionality!

>Space station generation has been temporarily disabled as I do some bugfixing
